# StudyFlow Enhancement Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Improvements

### 1. Task Completion Dialog System
- **Fixed Issue**: Task completion now requires confirmation through dialog boxes
- **Implementation**: Added AlertDialog confirmation for partial, half, and complete status changes
- **User Experience**: Users see descriptive messages explaining each completion status
- **Location**: `client/src/components/task-card.tsx`

### 2. Password Visibility Fix
- **Fixed Issue**: Password decryption now returns actual passwords instead of masked dots
- **Implementation**: Replaced bcrypt one-way hashing with reversible base64 encoding
- **Security Note**: Uses base64 encoding for demonstration - production should use stronger encryption
