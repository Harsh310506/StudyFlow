# ðŸ”§ Render Deployment Fix

## Issue Fixed
The original build was failing because `vite` was not found during the Render build process.

## Changes Made

### 1. Moved Build Dependencies
Moved these packages from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`:
- `vite`
- `esbuild` 
- `@vitejs/plugin-react`
- `autoprefixer`
- `postcss`
- `tailwindcss`

### 2. Added Backend-Only Build Script
Added `build:render` script that only builds the backend without frontend dependencies.

### 3. Updated Render Configuration
Updated `render.yaml` to use:
- Build command: `npm ci && npm run build:render`
- More reliable `npm ci` instead of `npm install`

## How to Deploy on Render

### Method 1: Automatic (Recommended)
Since you've pushed the changes to GitHub:
1. Your Render deployment should automatically trigger
2. It will use the new `build:render` script
3. Should build successfully now

### Method 2: Manual Redeploy
If automatic deployment doesn't trigger:
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Find your service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Deploy latest commit"

### Method 3: Configure Build Command Manually
In Render dashboard, you can also manually set:
- **Build Command**: `npm ci && npm run build:render`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`

## Environment Variables to Set in Render
1. `NODE_ENV`: `production`
2. `DATABASE_URL`: `postgresql://postgres.dscnchaccmcddmsxmgwf:F!c5CN3qU5bW4!i@aws-1-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres`

## Expected Build Process
```bash
==> Running build command 'npm ci && npm run build:render'...
==> Installing dependencies...
==> Building backend with esbuild...
==> Build completed successfully âœ…
==> Starting with 'npm start'...
```

## Next Steps After Backend Deployment
1. Get your Render backend URL (e.g., `https://studenttasker-backend.onrender.com`)
2. Update frontend configuration files with this URL
3. Deploy frontend to Vercel

## If You Still Have Issues
Try these troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check the build logs** in Render dashboard
2. **Verify Node.js version** (should be compatible)
3. **Try different build command**:
   ```bash
   npm install --include=dev && npm run build:render
   ```

The fix should resolve the "vite: not found" error you were encountering!
